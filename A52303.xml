            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The great ſervices you perform to the one, and the great affections you bear, and real courteſies you do the other, hath embol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent theſe my Meditations unto your protection, I ſhall leſſe fear the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Cenſures of others, if in your Lordſhips deep judgment I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the leaſt mite that may help forward devotion. You are the great Moderator of the rigor of the Law, and therefore what I cannot claim in juſtice, I humbly beg in equity, that is, a favourable ſentence for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe my crude conceptions under your Name, and I am enough ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, if no diſhonour be caſt upon you, by fixing your Honors name to a Work ſo unworthy.</p>
            <p>This indeed I had not done, had not your Lordſhips favour in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular obliged me to it. 'Tis by your Lordſhips influence upon me, that I glimmer as a little Star in the Church, and that I yield a more vigorous luſter is your Lordſhips endeavor, for which I have little to return but thanks in this poor acknowledgment. That you are a Patron to the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in general, is too large; and univerſal Propoſitions are as <hi>Catholica,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick medicines, that cure few. That you have been a Patron to my ſtudies, puts life into my old blood not to be faint and weary. A vice to which old age is ſubject, that is, to waſte and go out, except there be oile in the Lamp.</p>
            <p>That I no ſooner medled with this ſubject, was, becauſe I durſt not: The Myſteries herein contain'd, and the Art in the delivery were ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative, that I always held them fit for a mature judgment, which by length of years and obſervation is heightned in old men, till they wrack upon dotage. Beſides, I have obſerved, that the beſt of Expoſitors have preſented their thoughts upon the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in their riper years, and made them one of their laſt works. Heavenly raptures they met with in this
<pb facs="tcp:52967:3"/>Book, which raiſed their ſpirits and hearts, and beforehand prepared them to that place, to which they did approach. I have therefore writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after their Copy, and brought it to light, as the child of my old age, and then, 'tis ſuppoſed there may be many infirmities in it, which that your Lordſhip cover with your mantle, will be a ſignal Act of charity.</p>
            <p>The Motive that chiefly was moſt powerful with me to undergo this task, were thoſe Meditations and Devotions of others, which I uſed and peruſed upon theſe <hi>Hymns,</hi> Theſe to my judgment (weak I confeſſe) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd more of the Compoſers own Cenius, than of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy this, I conceived no better way, than to compoſe the Prayer in <hi>Davids</hi> words, which for the moſt part is here done, and though the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Verſes</hi> be here often inverted, yet this is done for the better Connexion of the whole. The ſcope and intent of the Pſalmiſt is ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved.</p>
            <p>Pray and Sing we ought with underſtanding, and that is not poſſible till we underſtand, what we Pray or Sing: Now to beget this knowledge in thoſe, whom I do deſire to animate and render devout in thoſe duties, the eaſieſt way I could think on, was, to preſent the whole Summe of every <hi>Pſalm</hi> in a brief <hi>Synopſis.</hi> This conſideration produced that <hi>Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> which I here offer. How happily or unhappily this is perform'd, I leave it to your Lordſhips exacter judgment.</p>
            <p>And yet there was another reaſon, which caſt me on this Subject. The face of the times were ſad and cloudy, and our Mother the Church in a mourning weed, as <hi>Rachel lamenting for her children, becauſe they were not:</hi> and yet upon the promiſes of God there was hope of a reſurrection. As then thoſe, who accompany their deareſt friends to their laſt home, though covered over with veſts of ſadneſſe, yet <hi>mourn not as men without hope:</hi> So I in this doleful and general funeral, as it were, of this our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, followed her to the grave (as the bitter and enraged enemies of hers hoped and boaſted) with a ſad heart and wateriſh eye: and yet in this depth of ſorrow I received this comfortable aſſurance, that the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection would appear for <hi>Zion,</hi> that her walls would be rebuilt and flouriſh; which beyond my expectation, (God be bleſſed for it) I have lived to ſee, and by your Lordſhips favor enjoy a large and honorable portion in it.</p>
            <p>Now that I might have ſomewhat ſuitable, and at hand ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe both theſe paſſions. I could not find any part of Scripture ſo apt and pertinent, as this little Epitom of the whole. By which I have been taught to grieve and hope, to lament and joy, to complain to my God, and comfort my ſelf in the deepeſt of thoſe complaints with thoſe lively and inſpiriting encouragements, which this Swan of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> hath left, to be ſung by all the good people of God in their extremities. The whole is <hi>Davids,</hi> the Method only mine, and if it ſhall find a Candid interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from others, and a favorable acceptation from your Honour, you ſhall oblige me to remain, what I am,</p>

Precepts and Rules of Virtue and Piety have to humane palates but a harſh taſte, and they go down, and are digeſted very hardly; but being contrived into a Poem, and conveyed into the ear by Muſick, the rigour and ſeverity is much abated, and we are pleaſed inſenſibly with the food, by the Art with which it is ſeaſoned. God knew well our queaſie and nauſeous ſtomacks, and therefore hath ſerved us our Dyet in a <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> Many good Precepts I have taught you, many Rules of life out of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, many Rules of Faith out of the Evangeliſts and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52967:5"/>
            <p>More than theſe nine years I have ſpent my time in the preparation of this ſpiritual food; but I fear me, the meat hath been too ſtrong, or elſe your digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not been ſo good as I deſired; ſo little fruit appears in your lives, that there be, who ſay, you have little Faith; <hi>Pudet haec opprobria nobis, &amp;c.</hi> A ſhame it is that it ſhould be objected, but more a grief that it is not eaſie to anſwer it.</p>
            <p>The Evil is ſpreading, and the Diſeaſe very dangerous, and I began to think how I might help it: At laſt, I thought to bring you the ſame meat in the <hi>Pſalm</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and to try whether Faith and Repentance dreſsed up in Numbers, might be effectual to amend your Lives, and confirm your Belief.</p>
            <p>Theſe Hymns are yet left you to ſerve God, theſe, when you meet every Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, you read; theſe, when you come to this place, you ſing; and it ſhall be the labour of my old Age, that the Leſſons which are here taught, as well as the Muſick and Meeter in which they are ſet forth, be brought to your ears, would I could ſay your hearts.</p>
            <p>And thither they would be brought, and there they would reſt, and have their effect, could you but ſing them with <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit; that is, with a ſoul truly affected with what you read, and what you ſing. <hi>Eadem eſt verborum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, quocunque modo proferantur; ſed multum refert, quo Spiritu, &amp; quibus coram Deo proferuntur Affectibus.</hi>

            <p>And it cannot be ſaid, how much power theſe have over the ſoul of man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſsible to contain them, but they will break out. <hi>My heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>was hot within me, at laſt I ſpake with my tongue,</hi> Pſal. <hi>88.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sect. David</hi> was a man of much experience this way, he had whereof to rejoyce; wherefore to grieve, he had ſufficient cauſe to fear, more to hope; and as theſe paſſions took their turns, ſo did his <hi>Pſalms;</hi> for now he rejoyceth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he mourns; one while he expreſſeth his Fear, at another time his Hope; and all in ſuch pathetical Rhetorick, that no Eloquence is able to come near it: He ſets himſelf before his God, opens unto him all his ſecrets, ſpeaks of God, to God, with his God, and poures forth his affections of Faith, Hope and Love, in ſuch quick and powerful words, that who ſhall lay them aſide, and make choice of his own, ſhall find them wateriſh, cold, frozen. I have lately ſeen ſome Meditations. Vows, Soliloquies of an afflicted ſoul, compoſed with <hi>Davids</hi> ſpirit, and <hi>Davids</hi> words, and it makes my ſoul in my body become like melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wax.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> That then we read or ſing theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> with hard hearts, and dry eyes, it is becauſe we want <hi>Davids</hi> affections, we rejoyce not in God, we grieve not that he is deported from us, we fear not his Power and Majeſty, nor yet hope in the ſtedfaſtneſs of his Promiſes. Quicken but your affections upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> grounds, and you ſhall find there are no ſuch prayers, no ſuch praiſes, as theſe of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never let any man fear that theſe words will not fit the affections of any pious and devout ſoul, ſince an egge is not more like an egge, nor a man a man, than the Spirit of God is conformable to it ſelf, in all the Elect ſons of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:52967:5"/>
            <p>Have theſe words united <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul to God? Have they made him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with Heaven? Doubt not but they may have the ſame effect in you; your confidence may be the more, when you commence the ſame Petitions to the ſame God, in the ſame words which he hath heard and granted already.</p>
            <p>Doth he in theſe expreſs his joy, his grief, his fear, his hopes? Be bold alſo to do the like, and then expect the like effect.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid, That they may be of ſingular uſe, when the heart is dilated with joy, and opened with that which pleaſeth, unfit they are altogether for a ſad and oppreſſed ſoul; for who ſhall ſing? who rejoyce? who exult? Is not this proper for chearful ſouls? <hi>Is any man merry, let him ſing Pſalms?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>James 5.</hi> What mirth can there be in pious men by which they are called upon to ſing to God? when they are obnoxious to ſo many ſtorms of troubles; ſuch variety of temptation in this life, that a man would think they ſhould have little mind to ſing any other Song than that of <hi>David, Multae afflictiones Juſtorum;</hi> and are <hi>Pſalms</hi> fit for ſorrow or mourning. <hi>Quis enim ignorat muſicam rebus triſtibus parum accommodam?</hi> All this is moſt true, for no ſad and ſorrowful heart ſings ſweetly, rather he mourns as a Dove, and chatters as a Swallow, he ſighs; he laments, he grieves. Neither do I deny that the beſt of Gods ſervants have alwayes ſufficient reaſons to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Couch, and bedew their cheeks with ſhowres of tears.</p>
            <p>When therefore they ſing, this is done out of experience, or aſsured hope, and both reſolves them into mirth within: A tryal they have of their Fathers love, that he hath ſaved them from the Jaw of the Lyon, and the Paw of the Bear; or elſe in the midſt of their afflictions, an inward ſenſe and perſwaſion of Gods good will and love to them, with which being content, they can ſing even in the Priſon, and rejoyce under the Whip. No man is able to expreſs, but he that feels it, the joy and content of that ſoul which is fully perſwaded that he hath peace with God; load ſuch a man with chains, tear his fleſh with Whips, threaten Fire, Swords, Rack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had experience of both: No man in greater troubles, no man more ſtrangely delivered; he might well then ſing <hi>Pſalms,</hi> for that in the greateſt of his dangers he had a full aſsurance of Gods love and good will to him; and this enlarged his heart to ſing, <hi>Thy Statutes have been my Songs in the houſe of my Pilgrimage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This difference then the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> hath from other parts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That whereas they may be read and repeated even by carnal minds, theſe can never be heartily ſung, except by ſpiritual men, and ſuch who have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Gods good will, either in their deliverance, or elſe the ſenſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in their greateſt extremities: They then are unapt to ſing theſe ſpiritual Songs, who are no more affected with what <hi>David</hi> ſings, than as if Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Protection, Love and Goodneſs did no way concern them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> Enough I hope I have ſaid to make you in love with this Book; for if either the utility or profit of it can move you, or the ſweetneſs of the harmony in it work upon you, then you cannot chooſe but prize it, as a Celler full of precious Oyle, whereby all your neceſſities may be provided for; or a Tree, or rather a whole Paradiſe of Trees of life, which bring forth fruits every Month, nay,
<pb facs="tcp:52967:6"/>every day and houre, whoſe fruit is fit for meat, and leaves for medicine.</p>
            <p>And what marvel? the Original thereof being from Heaven, not Earth; the Author God, not man; the Indicter, the Holy Spirit, not the wit of <hi>David;</hi> the Matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightneſs; the Form, Gods Word, the Word of Truth, the Word of Salvation; the Effects, light of underſtanding, ſtableneſs of perſwaſion, repentance from dead works, newneſs of life, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, joy, peace in the Holy Ghoſt. Laſtly, the end and reward, and ſtudy thereof, fellowſhip with the Saints, participation of the heavenly Nature, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of an immortal Inheritance that never ſhall fade away.

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> Now that we may ſing theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> with underſtanding, neceſſary it is that we do know that there is in many of them (as in other Scriptures) a double ſenſe; there is a literal, and there is a ſpiritual and myſtical ſenſe, and one is ſubſervient to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> The literal ſenſe is that which the Author firſt intends, in what words ſoever his mind be expreſſed, whether proper or tropical.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> The ſpiritual and myſtical ſenſe is, when the words being true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally in the Type, yet are referr'd to another matter, to Chriſt or the Church as the Antitype.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52967:7"/>
               <p>And the Reaſon of this diverſity is, becauſe that the Old Teſtament was a Figure of the New, and the New of our future Glory; we muſt then in very many places of this Book look further than <hi>David,</hi> have one eye upon him, and another eye upon Chriſt our Saviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> This our Prophet was ſo lively a Type of Chriſt, that in divers places of the Prophets, Chriſt is in expreſs terms call'd <hi>David,</hi> as <hi>Jer. 30. Servient Domino ſuo &amp; Davidi Regi ſuo, quem ſuſcitaberis.</hi> Ezek. <hi>47. Suſcitabo inquit Dominus ſuper ea, paſtorem unum, qui paſcat eam, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum meum David.</hi> Hoſ. <hi>3. Poſthaec revertentur filii Iſräel, &amp; quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Dominum Deum ſuum, &amp; Davidem Regem ſuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When then we find in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> a double ſenſe, the literal and mystical; that of the letter muſt firſt be found out, though our mind run upon the myſtical, as that which is the chief, and principally intended; for that muſt wait upon this, as <hi>Hagar</hi> did upon <hi>Sarah;</hi> and until the letter be well known, the myſtery contained under that letter, will never be well and fully underſtood.</p>
               <p>He that would rightly underſtand the true Analogy betwixt the Levitical ſacrifices, and the ſacrifice of our Saviours ſoul for the ſin of the whole World, muſt firſt be well acquainted with thoſe Moſaical Rites; and ſo he that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly judge of thoſe things which in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are myſtically ſpoken of Chriſt, muſt firſt ſee how they agree to <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as that man reads all the Ceremonial Law to very little purpoſe, who dwells upon thoſe ſhadows and figures, and ariſeth not to Chriſt, whom they ſignified; ſo doth not he study and interpret theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> to any great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who confines his thoughts in <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> or any other, and takes not occaſion by the figure to ſearch out the Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> Two ſorts of men there have been very much miſtaken in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>Pſalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> The firſt are the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judaizants,</hi> that refer whatſoever they find here to <hi>David,</hi> and to that Age; they make little or no account of Chriſt, and the Church collected by him, and under his Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> The other, who ſetting by <hi>David</hi> as but a Cypher, interpret every <hi>verſe</hi> and ſentence of Chriſt alone, and of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>That therefore both theſe Rocks, as <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charibdis</hi> may be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I intend <hi>(Deo Auſpice)</hi> to go in a middle way, and as occaſion ſhall be offered, firſt to explain the literal ſenſe, and ſhew the truth of the words in <hi>David,</hi> becauſe that is the Baſis and Key to the Myſtery; and then this literal ſenſe being explain'd with all poſsible brevity, to open unto you the ſpiritual, and ſhew what reſpect any <hi>Pſalm</hi> hath to Chriſt, that ſo you may have an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, full and perfect underſtanding of theſe ſpiritual Songs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quod quaedam, etiam in iis Pſalmis, quae in Novo Teſtamento ad Chriſtum referuntur, ſunt in literali ſenſu vera, in Davide, demonſtrat</hi> Janſenius. <hi>in Epiſt. Dedic. ante Pſalmos, quem conſulas.</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> hear my prayer, give ear, O God of Jacob. <hi>Thou who art our Shield and Protector, behold me with a ſerene countenance, and when I ſhall lift up my eyes unto thee,</hi>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> yea, and that it is better to be the meaneſt ſervant, a door-kéeper in the houſe of God, than to dwell with honour in the Tents and Palaces of ungodly men.

                     <hi>Marvellous, O ſwéet Saviour, was thy conception, marvellous thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, marvellous thy life, marvellous thy death.

And that we yet marvel the more, all this was done for us, when we were without ſtrength, and could not help our ſelves; without grace, and could not deſerve his, when we were ungodly, and thought not of him, ſinners that did provoke him, enemies that did cebell againſt him.</hi> In this then God commended his love, that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us.

                     <hi>This was a work that paſſed the power of men and Angels; Angels were too weak, and man too ſinful to undertake in it. Yet ſo great was thy love to loſt man, that rather than he ſhould periſh for ever, thou, who wert without ſin,

It was thine own right-hand without any other power, that did it; thine own arm without any aſſiſtant,</hi> that led Captivity Captive, and received gifts for men, yea even for thine enemies, that the Lord God might dwell among them.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that it increaſeth the difficulty; for full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction (if it be given by any) I refer you to the Tranſlators and Expoſitors:
<note place="margin">The ſenſe of theſe words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</note> Three opinions I find about the words. The Fathers expound them of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The later Divines, of his people, that were willing to ſerve him, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is moſt likely, and will beſt conſiſt and cohere with the ſenſe of the former words.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that expound them,
<note place="margin">Expounded of Chriſt.</note> and apply them to Chriſt, run not one way neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Some ſuppoſe the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks of his Godhead, ſome of his Manhood, ſome of his Gifts and Graces: Thus they open themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſay they, Notes out here Chriſts eternal Generation before all Worlds, following the Septuagints Tranſlation, that reads it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of the womb; that is, of mine own Eſſence, ſaith the Father to the Son, before the morning Star; that is, before there was Light or Star, which was the firſt Creature; <hi>i. e. before the World was, I have begotten thee,</hi> or, <hi>Thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> that is, thy Nativity or Birth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others apply the words to Chriſts Nativity of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and open thus their meaning: <hi>From the womb of the morning,</hi> that is, the Virgin, <hi>Thou haſt the dew of thy youth;</hi> i. e. Thy birth, which birth is therefore compared to dew, becauſe as a celeſtial dew the Son of God ſent from Heaven, was at his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conceived in the Virgins womb, without the ſeed of man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others, yet applying them to Chriſt, expound the words of the fulneſs of thoſe dewes, as it were of Gifts and Graces, with which his Humanity was inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and beautified, even from the womb, which is alſo very true; for he was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that holy one from the womb, and even then received thoſe Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in an abundant and plentiful manner, without meaſure, which he after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by portions to his Church: <hi>For of his Fulneſs it is that we receive; He was anointed with the oyle of gladneſs above his Fellowes,</hi> but yet for his Fellowes.</p>
               <p n="4">4.
<note place="margin">Of the Church his people.</note> Now this Interpretation, as I conceive, gave occaſion to our Modern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitors, to apply the words not to the Meſſias, nor to the plenitude of Grace in him, but to our new Birth, and the Graces then beſtowed upon his Subjects and people.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:52967:195"/>
               <p>By their Youth, they underſtand their Regeneration; by the Dewes, the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then beſtowed on them, which they have not from the will of man, nor from the will of the fleſh, but of God; or as the <hi>Prophet</hi> phraſes it, <hi>from the womb of the morning.</hi> As if the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid, By the preaching of thy Word thou ſhalt bring forth a people, not only good, but great, whoſe increaſe ſhall be ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and wonderful, as the drops of the morning dew: For as the dew that ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls from Heaven abundantly, covers and refreſheth the Earth; ſo thy power regenerating the hearts of men by thy Goſpel, and ſecret operation of thy Spirit, diſtilling as the dew, and as the ſhowers upon the herbs, is that immortal Seed, by which an incredible number of children are begotten to God. How properly may it be ſaid to, and of every regenerate man, <hi>from the womb of the morning;</hi> that is, not from thy ſelf, or any other womb, but from above, from the Spirit of God, <hi>Thou haſt the dew,</hi> thoſe ſweet and comfortable dewes of grace which do better and beautifie thy youth, thy new birth, thy youthful and lively condition in Chriſtianity, hence is thy birth, thy vigour, thy growth. And becauſe the <hi>Prophet</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>verſe</hi> ſpoke of Gods people, of their holineſs, their willingneſs, methinks it is moſt conſonant to the driſt of the Text, to expound theſe words of their Regeneration alſo, of their increaſe, of their growth in grace, and the cauſes of it; the Word of God, and the operation of his Spirit, which as I ſaid, is the dew: But I leave to every man to take for his guide in this caſe, either the Ancient, or Modern Divines.</p>

               </gap>, or <hi>Pſalmes</hi> of Aſcenſion or Degrees.</head>
            <p>WHY the fifteen <hi>Pſalmes</hi> following bear this Title, it is not certainly known, many conjectures there are; of which the moſt likely are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is of <hi>Rabbi, David, Kimchi,</hi> and it is moſt general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, that there were fifteen ſteps by which the Prieſts aſcended into the Temple, upon every one of which the Prieſts ſtanding, ſung one of theſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> aſcending by degrees from the loweſt ſtep to the higheſt, and for this Reaſon theſe were called <hi>Pſalms</hi> of Aſcenſion or Degrees.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond opinion, is that of <hi>Lyranus,</hi> which is near to the former; for he ſpeaks not of the ſteps of the Temple, but of a higher and more eminent place of the Temple, where the Levites were wont to ſing theſe fifteen <hi>Pſalms</hi> daily; and for this, he conceives, they were called Aſcenſions, or <hi>Pſalms</hi> of Degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they aſcended unto that place to ſing them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rabbi Saadias</hi> conceives, That <hi>Mahuloth</hi> had reference to a kind of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick or Melody; and when the word ſignifies an Aſcent, he ſuppoſeth that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were thereby admoniſhed, that when they ſang theſe <hi>Pſalms,</hi> they ſhould ſing with a full high voyce, a degree higher than uſual.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Abenezra</hi> refers not theſe to the intention of the voyce in ſinging, but to ſome Tune then commonly known, to which theſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> were ſet.</p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:52967:238"/>
            <p n="5">5. Some ſay they were ſet to be ſung by the Jews, when they came out of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and aſcended to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> But this is not likely, if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was the Author of them, as is generally received. More likely it is that they were compoſed to be ſung by the way when they went up to the Temple yearly. For they aſcended with a Pipe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath this Moral of it, that we ought ſtill to aſcend and be mounting upward from vertue to vertue, or from one degree of vertue to another, till we come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, and this is <hi>Nazianzenes</hi> conceit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> prefix before theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> this Title, <hi>Canticum excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiſſimum;</hi> it ſeems to me that their meaning was to affix this commendation, that they excel the reſt, and by ſome degrees were to be prefer'd. For certain it is, that in qualities, the more intenſe the quality is, the nearer to perfection, as we ſay, water that hath ſeven or eight degrees of heat, comes nearer to the true nature of heat, than that which hath but two or three; when then uſually theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> were called <hi>Pſalms</hi> of degrees, they were pleaſed to tranſlate it, a moſt excellent <hi>Pſalm.</hi>

                     <hi>An Appendix to the four laſt</hi> Verſes <hi>in this</hi> Pſalm.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe theſe laſt <hi>verſes</hi> have, according to mens fancies, been applyed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral purpoſes, as they might ſuit beſt with their intereſts, therefore I thought good to ſay a little more of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Jews</hi> firſt applyed them to the time ſucceeding their Captivity, and fancied to themſelves, that the promiſe was made to them, that <hi>they ſhould have a two-edged ſword in their hand,</hi> that is, power, <hi>to execute vengeance on the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> &amp;c. But he that ſhall read the ſtory of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> and <hi>Joſephus,</hi> ſhall find, that ſuch a time never came, that ſo far they were from binding Kings in chains, that Kings held them in bondage, as <hi>Antiochus, Seleucus, Tryphon, Pompey,</hi> &amp;c. This ſence then can have no foundation in theſe words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which the <hi>Jews</hi> that now live, perceiving, tell us, that theſe words ſhall have the accompliſhment at the coming of their yet expected <hi>Meſſias,</hi> for then they ſhall be Lords of the world, and <hi>bind all Kings they pleaſe in chains, and Nobles with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tters of Iron,</hi> &amp;c. But never any ſuch temporal <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhall come, and therefore this is but a fiction of their own brain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Anabaptiſts, Millenaries, Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> dream alſo of ſuch a golden age, they tell us of a thouſand years, that Chriſt ſhall come, and with his Apoſtles reign upon the earth, in which time his Laws only muſt take place, and that his Saints ſhall have a two-edged ſword in their hands, execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and puniſh who they pleaſe, binds Kings and Nobles in chains, puniſh who they pleaſe, <hi>and execute the judgement written.</hi> And the conſequent of this Doctrine is deſtructive and dangerous, as experience hath taught us in <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, John</hi> of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>yden,</hi> our new Sectaries, who upon it labour to unroot all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and deſtroy all that wear a Crown. But this is but an illuſion, for of
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:52967:281"/>Chriſt it is ſaid, <hi>That him the Heavens muſt contain, till the conſummation of all things, when Chriſt will come, and take his Elect to him, that where he is, they may be alſo;</hi> and that is into Heaven, not on Earth. Here then we may not expect to reign with him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth opinion there is, which is the moſt received, and by very judicious Divines, that theſe words are to be taken in a ſpiritual ſenſe, That by the Saints, are to be underſtood Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Succeſſors; that by the two edged Sword, is to be underſtood the Word of God; by Chains and Fetters, the Lawes and Precepts of the Goſpel; by puniſhments, the ſharp rebukes uſed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Word to ſtubborn ſinners, by the revenge taken on them, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which is a revenge taken for a former ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. which being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the ſenſe will run thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let the hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gh praiſes of God be in the mouth of his Miniſters, and the two-edged Sword of the Goſpel,</hi> Hebr. 4.12. <hi>in their hand, to execute vengeance upon the Heathen,</hi> to bring them to repentance, and make them take revenge upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, for their former wayes and puniſhments, to utter ſharp rebukes upon the people; to bind, not the people only, and <hi>Plebians,</hi> but even the moſt mighty Kings and Princes, Nobles and great men with the Lawes of Chriſt, and Precepts of the Goſpel, as faſt, as if they were bound with Chains of Braſs, and Fetters of Iron: And 'tis known how the greateſt Princes have ſubmitted their necks to the yoke and Doctrine of Chriſt. <hi>To execute upon them the judgment written:</hi> Not that any of Chriſts Miniſters uſurp Authority over Kings and Princes in temporal matters; for they are only to proceed according to the letter of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>Go and teach all Nations,</hi> and acquaint the greateſt Princes, <hi>That if they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and believe the Gospel, they ſhall be ſaved; but if they believe not, they ſhall be damned: This is the judgment written;</hi> and it is executed, when proclaimed and preached to them; which, if it take no place, it is beyond their Commiſſion to raiſe Arms againſt them: This is no where written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now this is the honour of all his Saints,</hi> of all thoſe whom he hath entruſted with his Commiſſion. And indeed an honour it is unto them to be his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors and Heraulds.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth interpretation, is that which I mentioned before in the <hi>Analyſis,</hi> who apply the Text to the Judiciary power, that the Saints receive at the laſt day, and I rather embrace it than the former: But I leave every one to his choice.</p>
